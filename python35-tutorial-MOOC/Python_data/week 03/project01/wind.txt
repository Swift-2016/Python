<1> How many roads must a man walk down
<2> Before they call him a man
<3> How many seas must a white dove sail
<4> Before she sleeps in the sand
<5> How many times must the cannon balls fly
<6> Before they're forever banned
<7> The answer my friend is blowing in the wind
<8> The answer is blowing in the wind
